getStationGauge <- function(target.loc="CPER"){
  
  "
  Author: Joe
  
  Returns precipitation record and locational attributes for the target
  location. Default is Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) but alternative
  locations at COOP sites across Colorado may be specified.
  
  If CPER (default):
  
  Zone Weights `zonewt` are read from the Excel model which is based on [xx]
  drought calculator state forage potential weights that we cannot reproduce.
  We are missing spatial reference information necessary to assign each target
  location to a state zone.
  
  Weights Zone `stzone` which corresponds to the state weights zone in which
  CPER resides (Colorado Zone 3).
  
  Station Gauge `stgg`, historical precipitation totals dating back to 1948,
  which are also read in from the Excel model. Precip totals are collected at
  CPER itself and do not rely on precip data from COOP sites.
  
  Target Grid Cell `tgrid`, for reading in PRF index values at a given point
  in time. `tgrid` is assigned to the PRF grid cell where we assume CPER exists,
  25002.
  
  If COOP site (user-specified):
  
  Zone Weights `zonewt` are based upon the Major Land Resource Area in which
  the COOP site resides. The MLRA forage potential is an average of plant growth
  curves calculated for a series of ecological site surveys (ESS) performed for
  that MLRA (using functions `COOPinMRLA` `getMLRAWeights`). Our decision to
  use an average plant growth curve is a placeholder that could be replaced,
  for example, by a regression framework like the one used to calculate
  the state weights. Alternatively, we could contact the authors of the
  [xx] state weights and use these instead of MLRAs (since these are
  likely more accurate than the weights used here).
  
  Weights Zone which in this case corresponds to the MLRA site within which
  the target COOP site resides.
  
  Station Gauge `stgg`, which is read from the historical precipitation data
  `precip` attached to the target COOP site list `target.coop`.
  
  Target Grid Cell which belongs to the list of COOP site attributes
  `target.coop`. This variable is computed by converting the coordinates of
  the COOP site to a SpatialPoint object and finding the underlying PRF
  grid cell.
  
  Upon completion of the function `getStationGauge`, a new sub-environment
  `station.gauge` is generated, which contains `zonewt`, `stzone`, `stgg`,
  and `tgrd` based on the target location.
