  Returns a weight representing
  annual forage production for a
  given gridcell or station
  gauge's annual precip record.
  
  By default, computes the sum of weighted product of
  forage potential and long-term precipitation deviation
  from average for a given year relative to a grid cell
  or station gauge's period of record.
  
  A 'decision making under uncertainty' mode is also
  available (when 'decision' is set to TRUE):
  
  To build monthly weights, generates a typology
  of years 1948-2015 (k-medoids) based on
  monthly precip values observed at the
  station.
  
  To assemble the weights:
  
  Use the product of deviation in precip from
  long-term (1948-2015) average * zone weights
  for months occurring before & during the
  decision month.
  
  For months occurring after
  the decision month, use the product of group
  average deviation from the long-term
  average * zone weight.
  
  This approach roughly approximates a 'best guess'
  scenario based on rain gauge observations -
  what should my precip for the remainder of the year
  look like given what I know by the decision month?
